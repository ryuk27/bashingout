# üîÅ 3. Control Structures

## ‚ùì If-Else Statements
Conditional statements allow you to execute different code depending on whether a condition is true or false. The basic syntax looks like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Basic if-else statement

if [ condition ]; then
  # Commands to execute if condition is true
  echo "Condition is true"
else
  # Commands to execute if condition is false
  echo "Condition is false"
fi
```

Condition: This can be a test like file existence, string comparison, etc.

`[ ]`: Square brackets are used for the test condition. It's an alias for the test command.

Examples:
Checking if a file exists:

```bash
if [ -f "/path/to/file" ]; then
  echo "File exists"
else
  echo "File does not exist"
fi
```

Checking if a variable is empty:

```bash
if [ -z "$name" ]; then
  echo "Name is empty"
else
  echo "Name is $name"
fi
```

Test Operators:

- `-f`: Checks if a file exists.
- `-z`: Checks if a string is empty.
- `-e`: Checks if a file exists (including directories).

## üîÑ Case Statements
The case statement allows you to match multiple patterns to a variable or string.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Basic case statement

case $variable in
  pattern1)
    # Code to run if $variable matches pattern1
    echo "Pattern 1 matched"
    ;;
  pattern2)
    # Code to run if $variable matches pattern2
    echo "Pattern 2 matched"
    ;;
  *)
    # Default action if no pattern matches
    echo "No match found"
    ;;
esac
```

Explanation:

- The case keyword evaluates the variable and checks it against the patterns.
- Each pattern ends with a ).
- The ;; ends each case block.
- * is the default (or "else" case) for unmatched patterns.

Example: Checking for user input
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number (1-3):"
read number

case $number in
  1)
    echo "You selected One"
    ;;
  2)
    echo "You selected Two"
    ;;
  3)
    echo "You selected Three"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Invalid selection"
    ;;
esac
```

## üîÑ For Loops
A for loop allows you to iterate over a set of values or range. It's useful for tasks that require repetition, such as checking files, running commands on multiple hosts, etc.

Basic syntax:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for var in value1 value2 value3
do
  echo $var
done
```

Explanation: The for loop runs through the list (value1, value2, value3) and assigns each value to var in turn.

Example 1: Iterate through a range of numbers
```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
  echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

Example 2: Iterating over files in a directory
```bash
for file in /path/to/directory/*
do
  echo "Processing file: $file"
done
```

## üîÅ While Loops
A while loop runs a set of commands as long as a condition is true. It's commonly used for polling or running until a specific condition is met.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Basic while loop

while [ condition ]
do
  # Commands to run while the condition is true
done
```

Example 1: Count until a number is reached
```bash
#!/bin/bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]
do
  echo "Count: $count"
  ((count++))
done
```

Explanation:

- The loop runs as long as the count is less than or equal to 5.
- ((count++)) increments count by 1 after each iteration.

Example 2: Polling a file for content
```bash
#!/bin/bash
file="/tmp/testfile"
while [ ! -s "$file" ]
do
  echo "Waiting for file to be populated..."
  sleep 2  # Wait for 2 seconds before checking again
done
echo "File has content!"
```

Explanation: This loop checks whether the file is empty. If it is, it waits for 2 seconds and checks again.

## ‚è© Until Loops
An until loop is the opposite of a while loop ‚Äî it runs as long as a condition is false.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Basic until loop

until [ condition ]
do
  # Commands to run until condition is true
done
```

Example: Loop until a file exists
```bash
#!/bin/bash
file="/tmp/target_file"
until [ -f "$file" ]
do
  echo "Waiting for file to exist..."
  sleep 2  # Wait for 2 seconds before checking again
done
echo "File exists!"
```

Explanation: This loop waits for a specific file to exist. Once it finds the file, the loop exits.

## üö¶ Break, Continue, and Exit
break: Exits a loop prematurely, usually when a condition is met.

```bash
for i in {1..10}
do
  if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
    break
  fi
  echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

continue: Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds with the next one.

```bash
for i in {1..10}
do
  if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
    continue
  fi
  echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

exit: Exits the entire script or function with a specified exit status.

```bash
if [ $USER != "root" ]; then
  echo "You must be root to run this script"
  exit 1
fi
```

## üìù Control Structure Summary

| Control Structure | Description | Example |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| if/else | Conditional execution based on truth or falsehood of a test | `if [ -f "file.txt" ]; then echo "File exists"; fi` |
| case | Match different patterns to execute corresponding commands | `case $var in 1) echo "One"; ;; 2) echo "Two"; ;; esac` |
| for | Loop over a sequence of values or items | `for i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done` |
| while | Run commands as long as a condition is true | `while [ $count -lt 10 ]; do echo $count; ((count++)); done` |
| until | Run commands until a condition becomes true | `until [ -f "/path/to/file" ]; do echo "Waiting..."; done` |
| break | Exit the loop early | `for i in {1..10}; do if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then break; fi; done` |
| continue | Skip to the next iteration of the loop | `for i in {1..10}; do if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then continue; fi; done` |
| exit | Exit from the script or function with a status | `exit 1` |
