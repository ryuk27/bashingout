# 🧱 2. Basic Concepts

## 🐚 Shebang (#!/bin/bash)
At the top of any Bash script, you'll usually see the shebang line. This line tells the system which interpreter to use to execute the script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

Explanation:

- `#!/bin/bash` tells the system to use Bash as the interpreter.
- It's important to include this at the start of every script for portability.
- Without this line, the script will be executed by the default shell, which might not be Bash.

## 📝 Comments
Comments are written using the # symbol. Anything following # in a line will be ignored by the interpreter, making comments an essential tool for explaining your code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment explaining the next line of code
echo "Hello, World!"  # This prints "Hello, World!"
```

Single-line comment:

```bash
# This is a comment
```

Multiline comments: Bash doesn't have a built-in way to do multi-line comments like Python or other languages. However, you can use a trick by wrapping the comments in a block.

```bash
: ' 
This is a 
multi-line comment 
'
```

## 🧳 Variables
Variables are used to store values. In Bash, you don't need to declare the type of the variable, as it is inferred.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Assigning a value to a variable
name="John Doe"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

Local variables: Simple key-value pairs

```bash
age=25
```

Environment variables: Can be accessed globally and are usually defined with export.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/new/path"
```

Accessing variables: You can access variables by using $ or {} for clarity:

```bash
echo "Name: $name"
echo "Age: ${age}"
```

Special variables:

- `$0`: The script name
- `$1`, `$2`, `$3`,...: Positional parameters (arguments passed to the script)
- `$@`: All arguments as a list
- `$#`: Number of arguments passed to the script
- `$?`: Exit status of the last command

## 📝 Reading Input from the User (read)
You can prompt the user to enter input using the read command.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Ask for the user's name
echo "Enter your name:"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

Explanation: The read command waits for the user to type something and stores it in the variable name.

## 💬 Printing Output (echo and printf)
echo: Simple command to print text to the screen.

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

printf: More flexible than echo for formatted output.

```bash
printf "Hello, %s!\n" "$name"
```

echo automatically adds a newline at the end of the output. If you need more control over formatting, use printf.

## 🎯 Exit Status and Exit Codes
Every command in Bash returns an exit status (also called an exit code) to indicate if it ran successfully or failed.

- Success: Exit status 0 means the command ran successfully.
- Failure: Exit status non-zero (usually 1 or another number) means something went wrong.

To check the exit status of the last command, use $?.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello"
echo $?  # Will return 0 if the previous echo was successful

ls /nonexistent/directory
echo $?  # Will return a non-zero value (e.g., 2) if 'ls' fails
```

## 🖥️ Executing Commands in Scripts
You can run system commands directly in Bash scripts. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Running system commands
date
ls -l
```

Command substitution: Capture the output of a command and assign it to a variable.

```bash
current_date=$(date)
echo "The current date is: $current_date"
```

## 🏷️ Quoting in Bash
There are different ways to quote text in Bash to control how variables and special characters are interpreted.

Double Quotes ("): Allows variable expansion (substitution) inside the quotes.

```bash
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name!"  # Expands $name to "John"
```

Single Quotes ('): Prevents variable expansion. Useful for printing exact text.

```bash
name="John"
echo 'Hello, $name!'  # Prints the literal text '$name!'
```

Escape Character (\): Used to escape special characters within double quotes.

```bash
echo "This is a \"quoted\" word."
```

## 🧰 Basic File Operations
You can use Bash to interact with files and directories. Here are some common commands:

Creating a file:

```bash
touch file.txt
```

Listing files:

```bash
ls
```

Changing directories:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Deleting a file:

```bash
rm file.txt
```

Redirecting output:

```bash
echo "This is a test" > output.txt
```
