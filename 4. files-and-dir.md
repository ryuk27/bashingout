# 📁 4. Working with Files and Directories

## 📂 Creating and Removing Files and Directories

* **Create a file**:
```bash
touch file.txt
```

* **Create a directory**:
```bash
mkdir my_folder
```

* **Remove a file**:
```bash
rm file.txt
```

* **Remove an empty directory**:
```bash
rmdir my_folder
```

* **Remove directory recursively (non-empty)**:
```bash
rm -r my_folder
```

* **Create a directory only if it doesn't exist**:
```bash
[ ! -d "dir_name" ] && mkdir dir_name
```

## 📁 Listing Files and Directory Contents

* **Basic listing**:
```bash
ls
```

* **Detailed listing**:
```bash
ls -l
```

* **Including hidden files**:
```bash
ls -a
```

* **Sorted by time (recent first)**:
```bash
ls -lt
```

## 📑 Reading and Writing Files

* **Redirect output to a file**:
```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > file.txt # Overwrites
```

* **Append output to a file**:
```bash
echo "New line" >> file.txt # Appends
```

* **Read a file line-by-line**:
```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo "Line: $line"
done < file.txt
```
   * `IFS= read -r line` preserves whitespace and backslashes.

## ✏️ Editing File Content from Bash

To edit file contents, you typically combine Bash with Unix tools like `sed`, `awk`, or `tr`.

* **Replace a word using** `sed`:
```bash
sed -i 's/oldword/newword/g' file.txt
```

* **Delete blank lines**:
```bash
sed '/^$/d' file.txt
```

* **Transform to uppercase**:
```bash
tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < file.txt
```

## 🕵️ Checking File Properties

You can test file attributes using conditionals:
```bash
if [ -f "file.txt" ]; then
  echo "It's a regular file"
fi

if [ -d "my_folder" ]; then
  echo "It's a directory"
fi
```

* Common test options:

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-f` | Is it a regular file? |
| `-d` | Is it a directory? |
| `-e` | Does the file exist? |
| `-s` | Is the file non-empty? |
| `-r` | Is the file readable? |
| `-w` | Is the file writable? |
| `-x` | Is the file executable? |

## 🔄 File Copying and Moving

* **Copy a file**:
```bash
cp source.txt dest.txt
```

* **Move or rename a file**:
```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

* **Copy recursively**:
```bash
cp -r dir1 dir2
```

## 🧾 Find Files

* **Find files by name**:
```bash
find /path -name "file.txt"
```

* **Find all** `.log` files:
```bash
find . -type f -name "*.log"
```

* **Find files modified in the last 24 hours**:
```bash
find . -type f -mtime -1
```

## 🛑 File Permissions and Ownership

* **View permissions**:
```bash
ls -l file.txt
```

* **Change permissions**:
```bash
chmod 755 script.sh # rwxr-xr-x
```

* **Make a file executable**:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

* **Change ownership**:
```bash
sudo chown user:group file.txt
```

* **Permission flags**:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `r` | Read |
| `w` | Write |
| `x` | Execute |
| `-` | No permission |

## 🧪 Example Script: Clean Up Old Log Files

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Delete log files older than 7 days from /var/logs
find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -exec rm -f {} \;
echo "Old log files cleaned up."
```
