# 📂 9: File Operations and Permissions in Bash

File operations are **core tasks in scripting**, especially for red teamers automating enumeration, log tampering, backups, or data exfiltration. Bash gives you powerful tools to **create, delete, copy, move, and change file permissions**.

## 📁 1. Creating and Deleting Files/Directories

🔸 Create an empty file
```bash
touch file.txt
```

🔸 Create a directory
```bash
mkdir mydir
```

🔸 Remove a file or folder
```bash
rm file.txt # Remove file
rm -r folder_name # Remove directory recursively
```

## 📤 2. Copy, Move, Rename

🔹 Copy a file
```bash
cp source.txt destination.txt
```

🔹 Move or rename a file
```bash
mv file1.txt file2.txt # Rename
mv file.txt /tmp/ # Move
```

## 🔎 3. Check if File or Directory Exists

```bash
if [ -f "file.txt" ]; then
    echo "File exists."
fi

if [ -d "mydir" ]; then
    echo "Directory exists."
fi
```

## 🔐 4. Permissions Management

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `chmod` | Change permission |
| `chown` | Change owner |
| `chgrp` | Change group |

🔹 `chmod` Examples
```bash
chmod 755 script.sh # rwxr-xr-x
chmod +x script.sh # Add execute permission
chmod u+x file.txt # Add execute to user only
```

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `u` | user (owner) |
| `g` | group |
| `o` | others |
| `a` | all |

🔹 `chown` Example
```bash
chown root:root file.txt # Change owner and group
```

## 🔁 5. File Content Operations

🔸 Display content
```bash
cat file.txt
less file.txt
more file.txt
```

🔸 Read file line-by-line
```bash
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "$line"
done < file.txt
```

🔸 Redirect output to file
```bash
echo "Hello" > file.txt  # Overwrite
echo "World" >> file.txt # Append
```

## 🧪 6. Temporary Files and Cleanup

```bash
tempfile=$(mktemp)
echo "Temporary file: $tempfile"
# Do something...
rm "$tempfile" # Clean up
```

## 🧰 7. Useful Commands for Red Teamers

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `stat file.txt` | Show file metadata |
| `ls -la` | List permissions, owner, time |
| `find / -type f -name "*.conf"` | Search files |
| `touch -d '2 days ago' file.txt` | Change timestamp |
| `cp --preserve=mode file.txt` | Copy with original permissions |

## 🔒 8. Real-World Example: Permission Checker

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in *.sh
do
    if [ ! -x "$file" ]; then
        echo "Making $file executable"
        chmod +x "$file"
    fi
done
```
