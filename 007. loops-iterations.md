# 🔁 7: Loops and Iteration in Bash

Loops are **essential for automation**, allowing you to repeat actions — whether scanning files, testing users, or brute-forcing permissions. In this section, we'll cover:

## 🔄 Types of Loops in Bash

### 1. `for` Loop

#### 🔹 Basic form

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```

#### 🔹 Using brace expansion

```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
  echo "Count: $i"
done
```

#### 🔹 Iterating over files

```bash
for file in *.txt
do
  echo "Found file: $file"
done
```

#### 🔹 C-style `for` loop

```bash
for ((i=0; i<5; i++))
do
  echo "i is $i"
done
```

### 2. `while` Loop

Executes **as long as the condition is true**.

```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]
do
  echo "Count is $count"
  ((count++))
done
```

#### 🔹 Example: Read a file line by line

```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo "Line: $line"
done < myfile.txt
```

### 3. `until` Loop

Runs **until the condition becomes true** (opposite of `while`).

```bash
count=1
until [ $count -gt 5 ]
do
  echo "Count: $count"
  ((count++))
done
```

## ⏹ Loop Control Statements

| Statement | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| `break` | Exit the loop early |
| `continue` | Skip to next iteration |

#### 🔹 Example with `break`

```bash
for i in {1..10}
do
  if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
    break
  fi
  echo "$i"
done
```

#### 🔹 Example with `continue`

```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
  if [ $i -eq 3 ]; then
    continue
  fi
  echo "i = $i"
done
```

## 🧪 Nested Loops

```bash
for i in 1 2
do
  for j in a b
  do
    echo "$i - $j"
  done
done
```

## 🔐 Practical Example: Check File Permissions in a Folder

```bash
for file in /etc/*
do
  if [ -r "$file" ]; then
    echo "$file is readable"
  fi
done
```

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Use `IFS` carefully when reading lines (preserves spaces).
* Avoid infinite loops unless intentionally using `while true`.
* For command output iteration, use `$(command)` inside a loop:

```bash
for user in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd)
do
  echo "User: $user"
done
```
